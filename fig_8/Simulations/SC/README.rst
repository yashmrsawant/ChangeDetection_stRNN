**Abstract**: The superior colliculus (SC) is a brainstem structure at the
crossroad of multiple functional pathways. Several neurophysiological studies
suggest that the population of active neurons in the SC encodes the location of
a visual target to foveate, pursue or attend to. Although extensive research
has been carried out on computational modeling, most of the reported models are
often based on complex mechanisms and explain a limited number of experimental
results. This suggests that a key aspect may have been overlooked in the design
of previous computational models. After a careful study of the literature, we
hypothesized that the representation of the whole retinal stimulus (not only
its center) might play an important role in the dynamics of SC activity. To
test this hypothesis, we designed a model of the SC which is built upon three
well accepted principles: the log-polar representation of the visual field onto
the SC, the interplay between a center excitation and a surround inhibition and
a simple neuronal dynamics, like the one proposed by the dynamic neural field
theory. Results show that the retinotopic organization of the collicular
activity conveys an implicit computation that deeply impacts the target
selection process.
